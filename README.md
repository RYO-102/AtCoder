# AtCoder Solutions and Algorithm Templates
This repository is memorandum of my # AtCoder Solutions and Algorithm Templates

This repository contains my solutions to AtCoder problems and useful algorithm templates.

## Summary

This project showcases programs from past contests, focusing mainly on problems rated C or higher in the AtCoder Beginner Contest (ABC). Additionally, it includes algorithm templates I have learned during my programming practice.

Feel free to use this repository as a resource for your studies or to tackle similar problems.

## How to Use

- Files named `ABC_***` contain solutions to ABC problems. They are categorized by contest and problem level.
- The file named `Basic_Algorithm_Template` includes various algorithm snippets that can be directly reused in your programs. Copying and pasting are encouraged!

## Updates

I aim to update this repository regularly with new solutions and improvements. Please visit frequently to track my progress and explore new content.
